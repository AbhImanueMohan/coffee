            <p>A 2017 review of clinical trias found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of
                intake
                and is more likely to improve health outcome than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily.
                Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk
                in
                pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by poor study quality,
                and
                differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size. </p>

            <p>Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry.Coffee cherries grow on coffess trees from a
                genus of plants called coffee. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs
                to trees. </p>

                <dt class="f9">* Types of Coffee Beans.</dt>
                <dd>The two main types of coffee beans are Coffee Arabica and Coffee Robusta. People also use a blend of
                    both beans. Both types of coffee bean taste differently depending on where and how they are grown.
                    The types of coffee beans we use are like gourmet coffee right in your home. Compare the types of
                    coffee beans we use versus any of our competitors, and we are sure you will be impressed. We ship it
                    so fast, we should tell you to wait a few days for it to peak.The Coffea Arabica bush is grown all
                    around the world and is the bean that over seventy percent of all coffee beverages are made from.
                    The Arabica bean is a highly flavorful bean that contains less caffeine than the Canephor coffee
                    bean. The different growing regions of the Arabic bean create different flavors in the bean.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt class="f9">* Type of Roast</dt>
                <dd>Though the bean itself matters, coffee gets a lot of its aroma and flavor from the roasting process.
                    The length of the roasting process can affect many things, including the body, acidity, and flavor
                    of your tasty beans. To help you expand your coffee knowledge, we’ve put together this handy guide
                    to the four major types of coffee roasts.

                    The four types of coffee roasts are light roast, medium roast, medium-dark roast, and dark roast.
                    Each of these roast levels has a different aroma, appearance, and flavor. Keep reading to learn all
                    about the four types of coffee roasts!</dd><br>
                <dt class="f9">* Type of Grind</dt>
                <dd>In most cases, your coffee making tool will define the grind particle you’re trying to get to.
                    Coffee beverages can be made via drip or under pressure, so the grinding process and grind size need
                    to match your coffee making hardware.

                <dt class="f9">* Decaffienated Coffee</dt>
                <dd>Decaf is short for decaffeinated coffee.

                    It’s coffee from coffee beans that have had at least 97% of their caffeine removed.

                    There are many ways to remove caffeine from coffee beans. Most of them include water, organic
                    solvents, or carbon dioxide (1Trusted Source).

                    Coffee beans are washed in the solvent until the caffeine has been extracted from it, then the
                    solvent is removed.

                    Caffeine can also be removed using carbon dioxide or a charcoal filter — a method known as the Swiss
                    Water Process.

                    The beans are decaffeinated before they’re roasted and ground. The nutritional value of decaf coffee
                    should be almost identical to regular coffee, apart from the caffeine content.

                    However, the taste and smell may become a little milder, and the color may change, depending on the
                    method used (1Trusted Source).

                    This can make decaf coffee more pleasing to those who are sensitive to the bitter taste and smell of
                    regular coffee.</dd>
